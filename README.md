# Pokedex Kotlin
This is an example of Android App that uses pokeapi.co to show the first 251 Pokemons. I used Model View Presentation (MVP) architecture, because it's easy to understand and very testable.

First of all, thank you Nintendo, Pokemon is an awesome world, I can't forget to mention all the series, games, mangas etc., since 1996.

I can't forget to thank either all resources used in this project like pokeapi.co, libraries, fonts, drawables and codes.
